# Null Check Failure in Dart After Null-Aware Operator

This example demonstrates a common error in Dart related to null safety and the null-aware operator (`??=`).  Even though we use `??=` to initialize `_myVariable`, a subsequent operation might still throw an error if not properly handled.

The issue occurs because, even though `??=` ensures a default value (0 in this case), the type of `_myVariable` remains nullable (`int?`). The line `_myVariable = _myVariable! + 1;` uses the null assertion operator (`!`), which may lead to a runtime error if `_myVariable` hasn't been assigned a value or is still null for some unexpected reason.

The solution demonstrates the correct handling of nullable types and provides a safer alternative.
